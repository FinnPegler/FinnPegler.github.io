<h1>Progress Page</h1>
 <p>I will add to this page, leaving everything up to show progression. My aim is to build up to a carousel rather than follow an article on how to build one. Then eventually when I have built a basic version I can implement improvements.</p>

  <h2>Task 1 - Messing around with event listeners</h2> 

  <p>I attempted to get the boxes to change colour when mouseover and when clicked.
  </p>

  <div id="boxes-container">
    <div id = "box" class = "red"></div>
    <div id = "box" class = "blue"></div>  
  </div>

<h2>Task 2 - Click the image to change the image</h2> 

  <p>Learning to show and hide images, which I think will be needed in the carousel. Struggling to get it working past the first click but will tackle that in task 3</p>

<div>
<img src="img1.jpg" alt="space nebula" class = "topimages">
<img src="img2.jpg" alt="space man" class = "hidden">

<br><br><br>


<h2>Task 3 -  Basic carousel</h2> 

  <p>Adding two images and clicking to move through them. Will attempt to use IDs instead of classes, and changing the source (.src) to change the image.</p>


<img src="img1.jpg" id = "carousel-image" class = "topimages">


<br><br><br>


<h2>Task 4 -  Overlay basic next/previous buttons on an image. </h2>

<p>Try to make it responsive so the buttons are fixed in the same point in the image.</p>

<div class = "container">
  <img src="img1.jpg" id = "task4image" alt="space nebula">
<div class = "bckbtn"><button class = "button1"><</button></div>
<div class = "fwdbtn"><button class = "button1">></button></div>
</div>
