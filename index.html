<h1>Finn's Website</h1>
 <p>I will continue to add pieces of code to the bottom of this page, and will leave everything up to show progression. I might move this to a subpage eventually depending on how the page turns out. My aim is to build up to a carousel rather than follow an article on how to build one. I will learn best this way. Then eventually when I have built a basic version I can follow an article and implement improvements.</p>

  <h2>1. Messing around with event listeners</h2> 

  <p>I attempted to get the boxes to change colour when mouseover and when clicked. It's not perfect but I learned enough to move on to the next task.</p>

  <div id="boxes-container">
    <div id = "box" class = "red"></div>
    <div id = "box" class = "blue"></div>  
  </div>

<h2>1. Add an image and a button that changes the image to another</h2> 

  <p>Placeholder paragraph</p>
