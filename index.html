  <h1><span>Hi Founders And Coders!</span></h1>
   <p>My name is Finn, thanks for visiting my website for the Founders & Coders spring 2020 application.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div id = "about">
    <p><strong>A little about me:</strong> as my day job, I own and remotely run a US based cleaning company. 
      After five solitary years bootstrapping and running the company I have decided it is time for a new challenge. 
      I have replaced myself in day-to-day operations and left to concentrate on learning to code. 
  
    <br><br><strong>My plan is:</strong> to find a position as a front-end developer in the next six months. 
    Being accepted to Founders And Coders would help me to advance this goal.
  
    <br><br><strong>Why FAC is a good fit for me:</strong> I love teaching people. While studying at University 
    I would set up study groups where each member would take a chapter and teach the group. 
    I enjoy synthesising new knowledge to a level that I can explain it in (hopefully) simple terms.</p>
