<h1>Finn's Website</h1>
  <h2>Ordered list of actions to work on this site</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>This is the beginning of my personal website for my Founders & Coders application.</li>
    <li>I am currently just committing directly on Github, without using a Git client. This week I will work on installing Ubuntu and GitKRaken, along with Sublime text editor.</li>
    <li>This evening is the November 18th Meetup which is on the topic of the carousel, so I will be attending.</li>
  </ol>
