<h1>Finn's Website</h1>
  <h2>Ordered list of actions to work on this site</h2>
  <ol style = list>
    <li>This is the beginning of my personal website for my Founders & Coders application</li>
    <li>Testing</li>
    <li>Deleting the README file worked. Not sure that is the best solution, I could probably have made Index the main file somehow, but I will come back to that</li>
    <li>I am currently just committing directly on Github, without using a Git client. This week I will work on installing Ubuntu and GitKRaken, along with Sublime text editor</li
    <li>This evening is the November 18th Meetup which is on the topic of the carousel, so I will be attending that meetup with my current setup of comitting directly on Github</li>
