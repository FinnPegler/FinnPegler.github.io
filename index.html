<h1>Finn's Website</h1>
 <p>I will continue to add pieces of code to the bottom of this page, and will leave everything up to show progression. I might move this to a subpage eventually depending on how the page turns out. My aim is to build up to a carousel rather than follow an article on how to build one. Then eventually when I have built a basic version I can follow an article and implement improvements.</p>

  <h2>Task 1 - Messing around with event listeners</h2> 

  <p>I attempted to get the boxes to change colour when mouseover and when clicked. It's not perfect but I learned enough to move on to the next task.</p>

  <div id="boxes-container">
    <div id = "box" class = "red"></div>
    <div id = "box" class = "blue"></div>  
  </div>

<h2>Task 2 - Click the image to change the image</h2> 

  <p>Learning to show and hide images, which I think will be needed in the carousel. Struggling to get it working past the first click but will tackle that in task 3</p>

<div>
<img src="img1.jpg" alt="space nebula" class = "topimages">
<img src="img2.jpg" alt="space man" class = "hidden">

<br><br><br>


<h2>Task 3 -  Basic carousel</h2> 

  <p>Adding two images and clicking to move through them. Will attempt to use IDs instead of classes, and changing the source (.src) to change the image.</p>

<div>

<img src="img1.jpg" id = "carousel-image" alt="space nebula" class = "topimages">

<script src="my-script.js"></script>
